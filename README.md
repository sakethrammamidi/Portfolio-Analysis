# Portfolio-Analysis

📈 Stock Market Analysis with Python 📉

What's This Project About? 🤔
This project is like a super-powered magnifying glass for the stock market! 📊 We use some special tools and data to look at how stocks (pieces of companies you can buy) have been doing over time. This way, we can try to figure out which stocks might do well in the future and how to create a winning portfolio (a mix of different stocks) to make money while avoiding too much risk.

Why We’re Doing This 🕵️
The stock market can be confusing. Some stocks go up, some go down, and it’s hard to guess what will happen! With this project, we’re using Python (a type of programming language) to help make it easier to understand. We’ll be looking at the risks and rewards of different stocks, and we’ll try to create a smart mix of stocks to get the best returns possible!

What We Use 🛠️

Tools:
Python 🐍 - A programming language that helps us do the math and look at the data.
Yahoo Finance 💵 - A website where we get the stock data from (like prices, history, etc.).
Efficient Frontier Analysis 📉📈 - A fancy method to find the best mix of stocks that gives us good returns with the least risk.

What You’ll See 👀
Risk-Return Profiles 📈: This shows us how risky each stock is and how much reward (profit) we might get.
Maximize Sharpe Ratio 💼: The Sharpe Ratio is a way of seeing if a stock gives us a lot of rewards for the risks we’re taking. The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better!
Efficient Frontier Graph 📊: This is a chart that shows us the "best" mix of stocks to get good returns without taking on too much risk.

How to Run This 🚀
Download the Files 📂: Grab all the files here from GitHub.
Run the Code 🖥️: Open the Python files, and run them. It will use data from Yahoo Finance.
Look at the Results 🎉: Check out the charts and numbers to see what stocks might be good to buy!

That’s It! 🎉

This project is a simple way to understand the stock market a bit better using Python and data!
